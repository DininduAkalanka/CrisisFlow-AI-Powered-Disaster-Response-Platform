1️⃣ EfficientNetV2 analyzes the image:
   - Checks for: flood, fire, building_damage, road_block, safe
   - Assigns confidence scores (0-100%)
   
2️⃣ Decision Logic (in code):
   ```python
   is_disaster = not any(c["label"] == "safe" for c in detected_classes)
   ```
   
   Translation:
   - If "safe" detected → is_disaster = FALSE → REJECT
   - If "flood/fire/damage" detected → is_disaster = TRUE → ACCEPT
   
3️⃣ Application Response:
   
   FAKE IMAGE DETECTED:
   ├─ Status: REJECTED
   ├─ AI Confidence: 0.02 (very low)
   ├─ Verification Notes: "AI detected non-disaster image"
   ├─ Dashboard: Shows in "Suspicious Reports" section
   └─ Requires: Manual admin review
   
   REAL DISASTER DETECTED:
   ├─ Status: VERIFIED
   ├─ AI Confidence: 0.92 (high)
   ├─ Urgency: AUTO-ESCALATED to CRITICAL
   ├─ Dashboard: Shows in "Active Incidents" with red marker
